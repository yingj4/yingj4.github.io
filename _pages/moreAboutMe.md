## Sports
I love playing soccer and watching soccer games. I have been a goalkeeper in the middle school and mainland soccer teams at HKUST. Now I am the goalkeeper in CFA at UIUC. I also played as a goalkeeper in the IMLeague. I am a big fan of Chelsea and Beijing Guoan. Frank Lampard is my favorite player.

Other than soccer, I also work out at the gym.

## Music
I am an amateur of the piano. I have the absolute pitch.

I enjoy listening to all kinds of music in my spare time and when working out at the gym. [Jay Chou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou) is my favorite. I also listen to songs by [Urashimasakatasen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urashimasakatasen) (especially [Senra](https://utaite.fandom.com/wiki/Senra), [Nqrse](https://utaite.fandom.com/wiki/Nqrse), [Linkin Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkin_Park), and [Hacken Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacken_Lee).

## TV Series
I love Deadpool (both the comic one and the one Ryan Reynolds plays). I am a big fan of Marvel.

I also love the TBBT series. TBBT is one of the reasons why I want to do a Ph.D. (half-kidding).
